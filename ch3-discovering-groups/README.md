# ch3-discovering-groups

Introduces data clustering, a method for discovering and visualizing groups
of things, people, or ideas that are all closely related. In this chapter, we’ll learn:
how to prepare data from a variety of sources; two different clustering algorithms;
more on distance metrics; simple graphical visualization code for viewing the gener-
ated groups; and finally, a method for projecting very complicated datasets into two
dimensions.

Clustering is used frequently in data-intensive applications. Retailers who track
customer purchases can use this information to automatically detect groups of cus-
tomers with similar buying patterns, in addition to regular demographic informa-
tion. People of similar age and income may have vastly different styles of dress, but
with the use of clustering, “fashion islands” can be discovered and used to develop a
retail or marketing strategy. Clustering is also heavily used in computational biology
to find groups of genes that exhibit similar behavior, which might indicate that they
respond to a treatment in the same way or are part of the same biological pathway.
